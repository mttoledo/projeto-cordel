# project-cordel

Website developed following module 3 of the course of HTML5 + CSS3 from CursoemVÃ­deo, taught by Gustavo Guanabara.

In this project, it was necessary to apply various principles related to the <background> tag, such as the parallax effect. 

Additionally, a workaround was implemented to substitute the media query feature, using viewport width as a measure to adjust font size across different screen dimensions.

Comparing my finished project with the professor's, I observed that despite achieving identical results, my code's structure varied slightly. My priority was to enhance readability as much as possible, and I believe I achieved a good result.
